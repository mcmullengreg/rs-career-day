# Career Day at Rising Sun

Short presentation for the Rising Sun Middle/High School career day.

##What is a web developer

- Wikipedia: A programmer specializing in the development of Worldwide Web Applications that are run over HTTP from a web server to a web browser
- Web developers come in a variety of “flavors” from front-end, dealing with User Experience and Interaction to back-end, working with server side code and database interactions.
- Some web developers may also double as web designers, but the two positions are not the same thing
- Personally, I work as both a front-end and a back-end developer. I spend nearly 75% of my time as a front-end developer.
- Web developers build and maintain websites with client and consumer in mind.
- Knowledge in HTML, JavaScript and Cascading Stylesheets are musts
- A web developer should be able to take a design (from an image) and turn it into code.

##Education

- For web development, education is what you put into it. I started programming at your age when I took an HTML course at the career center. In high school I took a Visual Basic course, and programmed a TI-83+ calculator.
- In college, I majored in Business Management and took two other HTML courses and one database design course. 
- While web development is programming, you don’t need to study computer science to do it well. Some people study Information Systems, Graphic or web design with supplemental HTML courses
- To build a simple website all you need is a computer and a text editor (such as notepad). From here, you can start writing basic HTML. To enhance a site you should use CSS and HTML
- More advanced sites use server-side frameworks such as PHP, ColdFusion, ASP.Net, Ruby and Python, but these require a web server.
- For an even more advanced site development, you could use jQuery, SASS and other tools such as Git, Node.JS, Bower and Grunt
- The sites on the screen offer free resources to learn how to code, but make sure to check with your parents before you sign up.

##Likes and Dislikes

- One of my biggest pet peeves is being called a web designer. I’m not nearly as creative as those folks. Web developers are much more analytical, and that’s where I fall.
- Some projects, such as creating e-mails, can be repetitive and boring.
- WYSIWIG (What you see is what you get) editors, similar to MS Word for web programming, bother me for the inadequate code the write.

- I LOVE not having to wear a tie to work. 
- I also love being able to do my job anywhere, even the coffeeshop down the street. As long as I have an internet connection, I can work.
- I also love being at the forefront of technology, although there are still some limitations due to supporting older internet browsers, Xavier allows us to develop future ready websites. Some of that includes
- SNOW and FIREWORKS 

##Facts and Figures

- CERN launched the first website in 1991 and in 1993 opened up the World Wide Web to the public
- When I put this together, there were 965 million active websites and 4.73 billion pages on the internet. 
- To put that into perspective, in 2010, Google said there were 130 million books published in the entire world.
- Xavier’s website currently has 9,225 pages and generated 11.7 million page views with 4.07 million visitors in 2014.
